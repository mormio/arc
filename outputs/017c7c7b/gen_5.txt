    You are an AI tasked with solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. 
    You have access to a library of functions to help you solve these problems. 
    Your task is to propose a solution using these functions and any other new 
    functions you can choose to write. You may not need to use any of the functions 
    in the provided library. 

    Problem:
    Input 1: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]
Output 1: [[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0]]

Input 2: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
Output 2: [[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]

Input 3: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]
Output 3: [[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]

    Propose a solution to transform the input into the output. 
    Be specific about which functions you use and how you combine them. You do not need to
    import. Your solution should be a python function wrapped in ```.

    Your solution:
     ```python
def transform(input: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Duplicate each column twice
    duplicated_cols = duplicate_cols(input, 2)
    
    # Shift each column to the right by 1 position
    shifted_cols = shift_cols(duplicated_cols, 1)
    
    # Shift each row down by 1 position
    shifted_rows = shift_rows(shifted_cols, 1)
    
    return shifted_rows
```

    Note: The solution is based on the assumption that the input grid has at least 2 rows and 2 columns. If this is not the case, the solution may not work as expected. 

    This solution first duplicates each column twice using the `duplicate_cols` function. Then, it shifts each column to the right by 1 position using the `shift_cols` function. Finally, it shifts each row down by 1 position using the `shift_rows` function. The resulting grid is then returned. 

    The `duplicate_cols` function is used to duplicate each column twice, which is equivalent to increasing the value in each column by 1. The `shift_cols` function is then used to shift each column to the right by 1 position, which is equivalent to moving the increased value to the next column. Finally, the `shift_rows` function is used to shift each row down by 1 position, which is equivalent to moving the increased value to the next row. 

    This solution assumes that the input grid has at least 2 rows and 2 columns. If this is not the case, the solution may not work as expected. 

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the input grid. The space complexity is also O(n*m), as the solution creates a new grid with the same number of rows and columns as the input grid. 

    This solution is a combination of the `duplicate_cols`, `shift_cols`, and `shift_rows` functions. It is a simple and efficient solution that works by duplicating each column, shifting each column, and then shifting each row. 

    The `duplicate_cols` function is used to duplicate each column twice, which is equivalent to increasing the value in each column by 1. The `shift_cols` function is then used to shift each column to the right by 1 position, which is equivalent to moving the increased value to
